# LocalSafeHouse
The Localsafehouse project described in is a Linux application. The goal of this project is to protect personal and sensitive files locally. Instead of just uploading and saving files into cloud platforms or third-party servers, this project mainly focuses on using novel verification methods include face recognition and fingerprint, and two-factor authentication to protect local files. According to the filesâ€™ importance level, each level has its corresponding verification. Some crucial files could be encrypted many times by using several encryption methods. In addition, the two-factor authentication technique is used together with encryption techniques; as a result, crucial files only could be opened when the user has one time security key, correct encryption order and correct decryption keys, which are sent by email to users.
